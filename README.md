# dynCOALIA

## Description
This project allows the user to reconstruct sources using different methods (wMNE/eLORETA), dynamic functional connectivity using sliding window (PLV/wPLI/AEC), and different dimensionality reduction methods (ICA subtypes, PCA, NMF and Kmeans). 
The main objective is to test different pipeline methodologies to extract the accurate dynamic Brain Network States (dBNS).

## TODO
Download the following source code of the project 
Unzip it to a specified folder
Do not manually add path to Matlab (will be automatically added in the code).
The main script to run the whole pipeline is called main_dynCOALIA (it includes all the above steps).

The user should download Toolbox folder from [here](https://github.com/judytabbal/dynCOALIA/releases/latest), unzip it, and add it to the path of the project: dynCOALIA/Toolbox
The user can also download simulated data as an example, and the realigned MRI structure from [here](https://github.com/judytabbal/dynCOALIA/releases/latest) and add them to the path of the project inputs: dynCOALIA/Inputs

Note that the simulated data here is based on a dynamic realistic model of the brain named 'COALIA'.
