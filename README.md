# dynCOALIA
This project allows user to reconstruct sources using different methods (wMNE/eLORETA), dynamic functional connectivity using sliding window (PLV/wPLI/AEC), and different dimensionality reduction methods (ICA subtypes, PCA, NMF and Kmeans). The objective is to test different pipeline methodologies to extract the accurate dynamic Brain Network States (dBNS).
The evaluation is based on a dynamic realistic model of the brain named 'COALIA'.

The following project should be installed without a manual adding path to Matlab (will be automatically added in the code).
The main script to run the whole pipeline is called main_dynCOALIA.

The user should download toolbox folder from here, unzip it, and add it to the path of the project: dynCOALIA/Toolbox
The user can also download simulated data as an example, and the realigned MRI structure from here and add them to the path of the project inputs: dynCOALIA/Inputs
