# dynCOALIA

## Description
This project allows the user to
\
1- Reconstruct sources using different methods (wMNE/eLORETA)
2- Estimate dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using sliding window approach and different phase and amplitude based metrics (PLV/wPLI/AEC)\
3- Apply different dimensionality reduction methods (ICA subtypes, PCA, NMF and Kmeans)\
The main objective is to test different pipeline methodologies to extract the accurate dynamic Brain Network States (dBNS) from simulated dense EEG signals.\

## TODO
1- Download the following source code of the project\ 
2- Unzip it to a specified folder\
3- Do not manually add path to Matlab (will be automatically added in the code).\
4- Download Toolbox folder from [here](https://github.com/judytabbal/dynCOALIA/releases/latest), unzip it, and add it to the path of the project: dynCOALIA/Toolbox\
5- Download simulated data as an example, and the realigned MRI structure from [here](https://github.com/judytabbal/dynCOALIA/releases/latest) and add them to the path of the project inputs: dynCOALIA/Inputs\
6- The main script to run the whole pipeline is called main_dynCOALIA (it includes all the above described steps).
\
Note that the simulated data here is based on a dynamic realistic model of the brain named 'COALIA'.
